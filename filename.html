<h1>TODAY AND TOMORROW</h1>
<p><p style="font-size: 22px"> <b>There is a lot of issues happening in the world right now and one of them is climate change, 
It is one of the major challenges of our time. From shifting weather patterns that threaten food production, 
to rising sea levels that increase the risk of catastrophic flooding, the impacts of climate change are global in scope and unprecedented in scale. . </b></p>

<p> <font color="blue"> <h3> <p style="font-size: 22px"> Extinctions are happening at what scientists estimate to be about 1,000 times the normal pace. 
Not only are we losing flora and fauna, we are also damaging our ecosystems, and throwing them out of balance – 
the effects of which we cannot anticipate due to the intricate and complex nature of these systems. </h3> </font> </p> <br>

<p><p style="font-size: 22px"> <font color="white">
 		<br>–Cause of climate change is burning fossil fuels such as oil, gas, and coal. When burnt fossil fuels release carbon dioxide into the air causing the planet to heat up.
            	<br>–Humanity’s increased use of fossil fuels such as coal, oil and gas to generate electricity, run cars and other forms of transport, and power manufacturing and industry. 
        <br>–Deforestation because living trees absorb and store carbon dioxide. 
 <br>–Increasingly intensive agriculture which emits greenhouse gases like methane and nitrous oxide. 
<br>–Global warming is caused by the greenhouse effect, a natural process by which the atmosphere retains some of the Sun's heat allowing the Earth to maintain the necessary conditions to host life. Without the greenhouse effect. The average temperature of the planet would be -18°C.</font></p>

<font color="brown"><p> <p style="font-size: 22px">  <br>–Rising maximum and minimum temperatures.
<br>–Rising sea levels.
 <br>–Higher ocean temperatures. 
<br>–Increase in heavy precipitation (heavy rain and hail)
 <br>–Shrinking glaciers. 
<br>–Thawing permafrost.
 <br>–Human health is vulnerable to climate change.
 The changing environment is expected to cause more heat stress, an increase in waterborne diseases, poor air quality, and diseases transmitted by insects and rodents. Extreme weather events can compound many of these health threats. </font> </p>
 <p> <h3> <font color="Fuchsia"><p style="font-size: 30px">  <u>Prevention of Climate Change </h3> </u> </p>
<p><p style="font-size: 22px">
<br>–Recycle
<br>–Drive a fuel–efficient vehicle
<br>–Stop deforestation
<br>–Say no to plastic
<br>–Encourage the use of renewable energies  </font>
<p><p style="font-size: 22px"> <font color="red"> <b> We can learn how our planet works. We can learn how to live on it without making a mess of it. 
We can help to keep it magnificent for ourselves, our children and grandchildren, and other living things besides us.
You can help by growing your own vegetables and fruits. You can help by planting a tree. Your new plants and trees will help to remove the greenhouse gas CO2 from the air. If you grow some of your own food, 
you will also help to prevent more CO2 from entering the air from the fossil-fuel-burning trucks, planes, and ships that transport your food to you from far away.</p> </b>
